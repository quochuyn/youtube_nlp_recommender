#Instead of machine learning
#this will be a baseline approach of using a simple filter to recommend videos
#of exact word matches between the filter and any video title

#Pro: A video title may be long but a few word exact or close match should always be filtered out

#Con: This will have limitations as sports can refer to a lot of things, but the exact
#word may not be present in the title, transcript, tag, description, etc.
#Con: Won't capture alternate spellings, abbreviations, etc.
