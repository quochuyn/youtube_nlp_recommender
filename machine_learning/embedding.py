#Goal: Take in a user's input on what to filter and list of videos from the YouTube API
# that match the primary query and then return the remaining video URLS that match the filter


#Example Here a user wants to filter out political videos
#Query: Patrick Bet David

#Filter Out: Politics

    Takes in a filter sentence and a list of video string titles and returns

    ----------
    model : sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer.SentenceTransformer
        The HuggingFace Senctence Transformer language model to perform
        encoding of the text.
    filter_sent : str

    list_of_videos : list
        The list of titles to be encoded by the `model`.
    threshold : int, default=0.19
        The threshold to filter videos by cosine similarity comparison.
